I have a doubt about this: do I also have to keep the kernel I’ve been provided with the board? Cause I read that yocto will also provide a kernel, but I suppose that the manufacturer of my board may have added patches or whatever to make it work, which not necessarily are included in the kernel built by yocto. Am I right?</td><td class="time"><a href="#t2014-08-03T09:27:33" class="time">09:27</a></td></tr>
<tr id="t2014-08-03T16:15:15"><th class="nick" style="background: #42427e">RP</th><td class="text" style="color: #42427e">luc4: you could use the firmware yocto builds but the kernel you were provided with. There is no guarantee they'll work together. A kernel built by yocto may or may not have the same patchset, depends which machine it is and how it was configued. If the board provider originally used yocto, there would be a good chance of it working for example. So it all really depends</td><td class="time"><a href="#t2014-08-03T16:15:15" class="time">16:15</a></td></tr>
