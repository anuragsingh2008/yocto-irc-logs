# yocto-project IRC Channels

The Yocto Project has a friendly community providing informal support and discussion, and we welcome your contributions in our mailing lists and IRC channels. These channels are provided on Freenode â€“ point your IRC client toward freenode.net, or click the link for a channel to join via web page.


``#yocto``: Chat with the Yocto Project development team and community in our primary IRC channel, #yocto on freenode. This is a good way to get immediate help or answers to quick questions; If nobody is awake on the channel, send your question to the yocto mailing list. (IRC Logs are available.)
